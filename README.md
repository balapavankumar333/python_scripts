## Overview

# Uppercase Letter Counter

This Python script (`count_letter.py`) reads the contents of a file named `Sample.txt` and counts the number of uppercase letters in the file. The result is then printed.

## Usage

1. Ensure that the file `Sample.txt` is present in the same directory as the script.

2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python count_letter.py

3. Sample.txt contains the following text:

    ```bash
    Hello World!
    This is a Sample Text File.
    COUNT THESE UPPERCASE LETTERS.
    
4 Result 
   Total uppercase letters found in the file: 25


# Dynamic Sorting

## Overview

The Python script (`dynamic_sorting.py`) allows the user to input a list of elements and dynamically sorts the list based on the specified sorting order (ascending or descending). 
The user is prompted to provide the number of elements and the elements themselves, and the script performs the sorting accordingly.

## Usage

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python dynamic_sorting.py
2 Result
Original List: [4, 2, 7, 1, 9]
Sorted List: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]



# Element Frequency Extractor

## Overview

The Python script (`extract_elements_with_frequency.py`) extracts elements from a list based on their frequency. It utilizes the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the list.
Elements with a frequency greater than a specified threshold are then extracted and printed.

## Usage

1. Run the script using a Python interpreter:

   ```bash
   python extract_elements_with_frequency.py


# Lambda Function Definition



This is a Python code example that demonstrates the use of lambda functions.


# Compute LCM Function

This Python function calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two given numbers using a simple algorithm.

 ```bash
   python least_common_mulitper.py
